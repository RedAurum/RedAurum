Hey there, @RedAurum here! ☁ 👋🚀 ☁ <br>
Love Web Design 💻 and playing video games🎮 
<hr>
I have always enjoyed making my content to use on the web. I acquired my first skills in HTML when I was a teenager, and I also started using Photoshop to edit digital images. <br><br>


Following online courses on YouTube and Udemy, I learned the basics of Web Development languages and Python. In a short time, I managed to make my first web page from scratch, and soon after I started practising with Bootstrap. I also have experience with Figma and Adobe XD creating wireframes and mock-up applications.

I am currently studying User Experience Design to take an active part in the Web Design and UX/UI industry in the future.📚

I am always learning something new 😎
