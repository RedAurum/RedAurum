Hey there, @RedAurum here! ☁ 👋🚀 ☁ <br>
Love Coding 💻 and playing video games🎮 
<hr>
I have always enjoyed making my own content to use on the web. I acquired my first skills in HTML when I was a teenager, and I also started using Photoshop to edit digital images. <br><br>


Following online courses on YouTube and Udemy, I learned the basics of Web Development languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and Python. In a short time, I managed to make my first web page from scratch, and soon after I started practising with Bootstrap. I also have some experience with Figma and Adobe XD creating wireframes and basics mock up applications.

I am currently studying Software Development and Web Design in order to take an active part in web development in the future.📚

I am always learning something new 😎
